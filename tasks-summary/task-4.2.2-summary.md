# Sub-task 4.2.2: Create WebSocket controller

**Completed:** 2025-10-24 10:00

## Description

Successfully implemented the WebSocket controller to handle client subscriptions, ping/pong health checks, and scheduled heartbeat broadcasts for maintaining WebSocket connections.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created WebSocketController** (`src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/websocket/WebSocketController.kt`):
   - `/app/subscribe` endpoint for client subscription acknowledgment
   - `/app/ping` endpoint for connection health checks (pong response)
   - Scheduled heartbeat broadcast every 30 seconds to `/topic/heartbeat`
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Support for both authenticated and anonymous users

2. **Enabled Scheduling** in main application:
   - Added `@EnableScheduling` annotation to `MrrSbApplication`
   - Enables `@Scheduled` annotation for heartbeat functionality

3. **Created comprehensive tests** (`src/test/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/websocket/WebSocketControllerTest.kt`):
   - 10 test cases covering all endpoints
   - Tests for subscription with user info
   - Tests for anonymous user handling
   - Tests for ping/pong functionality
   - Tests for scheduled heartbeat invocation
   - Tests for exception handling
   - Tests for timestamp accuracy and uniqueness

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Endpoints

**Subscribe Endpoint:**
- Client sends to: `/app/subscribe`
- Server responds to: `/user/queue/subscribed`
- Response: `{ status: "subscribed", user: "username", timestamp: 1234567890 }`
- Acknowledges client subscription and provides connection confirmation

**Ping/Pong Endpoint:**
- Client sends to: `/app/ping`
- Server responds to: `/user/queue/pong`
- Response: `{ status: "pong", timestamp: 1234567890 }`
- Allows clients to verify connection is alive

**Heartbeat Broadcast:**
- Server broadcasts to: `/topic/heartbeat`
- Schedule: Every 30 seconds (fixed delay)
- Initial delay: 30 seconds
- Helps maintain connections and detect disconnections

### Authentication

- All endpoints support JWT authentication via `AuthChannelInterceptor`
- Principal information extracted from JWT token
- Anonymous users supported (returns "anonymous" as username)

### Error Handling

- Try-catch blocks around heartbeat to prevent scheduler failures
- Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels (debug, trace, error)
- Graceful degradation on errors

## Test Results

All tests passing:
- 10 WebSocketController tests (new): ✅
- All existing tests: ✅
- **Total: 166 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 9 skipped**

## Test Coverage

**WebSocketControllerTest (10 tests):**
1. Subscribe returns acknowledgment with user info
2. Subscribe handles anonymous user when principal is null
3. Subscribe includes current timestamp
4. Ping returns pong response
5. Ping handles anonymous user when principal is null
6. Ping includes current timestamp
7. SendHeartbeat calls notification service
8. SendHeartbeat handles exceptions gracefully
9. Subscribe returns different response for different users
10. Multiple ping calls return different timestamps

## Important Notes for Future Tasks

- **Scheduling Enabled:** @EnableScheduling now active in main application
- **Heartbeat Active:** Server automatically broadcasts heartbeat every 30 seconds
- **Client Integration:** Clients can now:
  - Subscribe via `/app/subscribe` and receive confirmation
  - Send ping to `/app/ping` to check connection health
  - Listen to `/topic/heartbeat` for server heartbeats
  - Listen to `/user/queue/messages` for personal messages
  - Listen to `/topic/alerts` for high-priority broadcasts

- **Production Considerations:**
  - Consider adjusting heartbeat interval based on connection requirements
  - Monitor WebSocket connection pool size
  - Consider implementing connection limit per user
  - Add metrics for WebSocket connection health

## WebSocket Flow Summary

1. **Client Connection:**
   - Client connects to `/ws` endpoint
   - Provides JWT token in Authorization header
   - Connection authenticated via `AuthChannelInterceptor`

2. **Client Subscription:**
   - Client sends message to `/app/subscribe`
   - Receives confirmation at `/user/queue/subscribed`

3. **Health Checks:**
   - Client can send ping to `/app/ping`
   - Receives pong at `/user/queue/pong`
   - Server broadcasts heartbeat to `/topic/heartbeat` every 30s

4. **Message Notifications:**
   - New messages trigger WebSocket notifications
   - Sent to `/user/{username}/queue/messages`
   - High-priority alerts broadcast to `/topic/alerts`

## Next Steps

Phase 4 (WebSocket Implementation) is now complete! The next phase is:
- **Phase 5**: Service Layer Implementation
  - Sub-task 5.1.1: Implement message service (already completed as part of 3.2.1)
  - Sub-task 5.1.2: Implement notification service (already completed as part of 1.2.3)
  - Sub-task 5.2.1: Create datetime utility (already completed as part of 3.2.1)

Most of Phase 5 has been implemented already during earlier phases. The next unimplemented phase is:
- **Phase 6**: Testing Implementation
- **Phase 7**: Error Handling and Monitoring
- **Phase 8**: Deployment and Documentation
