# Sub-task 5.1.2: Implement notification service

**Completed:** 2025-10-24 10:03 (Retrospectively marked - implemented in Sub-tasks 1.2.3 and 4.2.1)

## Description

NotificationService was already fully implemented and integrated with WebSocket functionality. This service processes database notifications and sends real-time updates to connected clients via WebSocket.

## Key Features

1. **processNewMessage()** - Processes JSON notifications from PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY
   - Parses JSON payload with flexible field name support
   - Fetches complete message details from repository
   - Sends real-time notifications via WebSocket
   - Logs all processing steps for debugging

## Implementation Highlights

- **Database Integration**: Triggered by PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism
- **Real-time Delivery**: Sends notifications immediately via WebSocket
- **JSON Parsing**: Uses Jackson ObjectMapper for payload deserialization
- **Flexible Parsing**: Supports both `sms_id` and `id` field names
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Fault Tolerance**: Errors don't cascade to other components
- **WebSocket Integration**: Fully integrated with NotificationWebSocketService

## Files Created/Modified

**Already exists from Sub-tasks 1.2.3 and 4.2.1:**
- `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/service/NotificationService.kt`
- `src/test/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/service/NotificationServiceTest.kt` (8 tests)

**Modified:**
- `plan_sb.md` - Marked Sub-task 5.1.2 as completed (âœ…)
- `tasks-summary.md` - Added retrospective completion note

## Technical Details

- **Event-Driven**: Responds to database notifications in real-time
- **JSON Processing**: Uses Jackson for parsing notification payloads
- **Repository Integration**: Fetches full message details from OutboundSmsRepository
- **WebSocket Delivery**: Sends notifications to specific users and broadcasts alerts
- **Error Handling**: All errors caught and logged without crashing

## Integration Points

1. **DatabaseNotificationListener** (Sub-task 1.2.3)
   - Receives NOTIFY events from PostgreSQL
   - Calls NotificationService.processNewMessage()
   
2. **NotificationWebSocketService** (Sub-task 4.2.1)
   - Sends user-specific notifications to `/user/{username}/queue/messages`
   - Broadcasts high-priority alerts to `/topic/alerts`

## Test Coverage

8 comprehensive tests covering:
- Process notification with sms_id field
- Process notification with id field
- Handle message not found gracefully
- Handle invalid JSON payload gracefully
- Handle malformed JSON gracefully
- Handle empty payload gracefully
- Process high alert level message
- Process message without person

## Next Steps

This task is complete. Next is Sub-task 5.2.1 (Create datetime utility), which is also already implemented.
