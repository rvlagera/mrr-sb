# Sub-task 8.2.2: Create docker-compose.yml

**Completed:** 2025-10-24 11:50

## Description

Created a Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate the `mrr-sb` service with environment variables, health checks, and a dedicated network, streamlining local development and deployment.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Service Configuration**
   - Builds the image using the project `Dockerfile`
   - Exposes the application on port `8080`
   - Injects required environment variables with sensible defaults for local development

2. **Operational Settings**
   - Enables `restart: unless-stopped` for resilience
   - Adds a health check probing `/api/actuator/health`
   - Places the service on a `mrr-network` bridge network for future expandability

## Files Created

- `docker-compose.yml`

## Files Modified

- `plan_sb.md` – Marked Sub-task 8.2.2 as completed
- `tasks-summary.md` – Added Compose configuration summary

## Usage Notes

- Build and run: `docker-compose up --build`
- Override environment variables via `.env` file or shell exports
- Ensure PostgreSQL is reachable at `host.docker.internal:5432` or update `DATABASE_URL`
- Health check requires actuator endpoint exposed at `/api/actuator/health`

## Verification

- No Compose run executed in this environment; perform `docker-compose up` locally to validate.
