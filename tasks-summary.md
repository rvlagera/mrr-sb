# Tasks Summary

## Sub-task 1.1.1: Configure Maven dependencies

**Completed:** 2025-10-24 08:05:47

### Description

Successfully configured all necessary Maven dependencies for the Spring Boot project including:

- Spring Boot starters (Web, Data JPA, Security, WebSocket, Validation, Actuator)
- Kotlin dependencies (stdlib-jdk8, reflect, jackson-module-kotlin)
- PostgreSQL driver for production database
- JWT libraries (jjwt-api, jjwt-impl, jjwt-jackson) for authentication
- SpringDoc OpenAPI for API documentation
- Spring Boot DevTools for development
- Testing dependencies (Spring Boot Test, Spring Security Test, H2 database, MockK, TestContainers)

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Added all required dependencies** from the plan to pom.xml
2. **Configured test environment** with H2 in-memory database for testing
3. **Created test application properties** to allow tests to run without PostgreSQL
4. **Verified build compiles** successfully with `./mvnw clean compile`
5. **All tests passing** - the contextLoads test now runs successfully

### Files Created/Modified

- `pom.xml` - Added all Spring Boot, Kotlin, JWT, and testing dependencies
- `src/test/resources/application.properties` - Created test configuration with H2 database

### Important Notes for Future Tasks

- **Test configuration uses H2** in-memory database, while production will use PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL driver** is included as runtime dependency
- **JWT version 0.11.5** configured for authentication
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI 2.2.0** ready for API documentation
- **TestContainers 1.19.0** available for integration testing with real PostgreSQL
- **MockK 1.13.8** available for Kotlin-friendly mocking
- Tests are configured to use H2 dialect and create-drop DDL strategy

### Next Steps

The next subtask (1.1.2) is to create the package structure with all necessary directories for controllers, services, repositories, etc.

## Sub-task 1.1.2: Create package structure

**Completed:** 2025-10-24 08:09:30

### Description

Created the complete package structure for the Spring Boot backend with all necessary directories organized according to clean architecture principles.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Created all main package directories** under `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/`:
   - `config/` - For configuration classes (DatabaseConfig, SecurityConfig, WebSocketConfig, JwtConfig)
   - `controller/` - For REST controllers (AuthController, MessageController, UserController)
   - `dto/request/` - For request data transfer objects
   - `dto/response/` - For response data transfer objects
   - `entity/` - For JPA entities (Person, OutboundSms)
   - `repository/` - For JPA repositories
   - `service/` - For business logic services
   - `security/` - For security components (JWT filters, token providers, UserDetails)
   - `websocket/` - For WebSocket handlers and services
   - `exception/` - For exception handling and custom exceptions
   - `util/` - For utility classes (DateTimeUtils, etc.)

2. **Added .gitkeep files** to ensure all empty directories are tracked by git
3. **Verified structure** matches the plan specifications

### Files Created/Modified

- Created `.gitkeep` files in all package directories:
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/config/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/controller/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/dto/request/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/dto/response/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/entity/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/repository/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/service/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/security/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/websocket/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/exception/.gitkeep`
  - `src/main/kotlin/dev/themobileapps/mrrsb/util/.gitkeep`

### Important Notes for Future Tasks

- **Package structure follows clean architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **All directories are tracked** by git using .gitkeep files
- **Ready for implementation** of actual Kotlin classes in subsequent subtasks
- The structure supports future expansion while maintaining organization

### Next Steps

The next subtask (1.1.3) is to configure application properties for the Spring Boot application including database configuration, JWT settings, logging, CORS, WebSocket, and other application-wide settings.
